Multi-Merge-Sort
================

Implemented a multi-threaded sorting program that uses Merge Sort as the underlying sorting algorithm. The program had the ability to run with up to 4 threads, however, the Merge Sort itself was not multi-threaded. Computational comparisons were done on the threads.
